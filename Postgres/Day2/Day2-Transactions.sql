-- Transactions

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
	DELETE FROM events;
ROLLBACK;
SELECT * FROM events;

/*
The  events  all  remain.  Transactions  are  useful  when  you’re  modifying  two
tables that you don’t want out of sync. The classic example is a debit/credit
system for a bank, where money is moved from one account to another:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
	UPDATE account SET total=total+5000.0 WHERE account_id=1337;
	UPDATE account SET total=total-5000.0 WHERE account_id=45887;
END;
